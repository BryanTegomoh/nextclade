# With Conda

A [Nextclade conda package](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/nextclade) is available for Linux and macOS from `bioconda` channel:

```bash
conda install -c bioconda nextclade
```

> ⚠️ Note that new versions may appear on bioconda with some delay (hours to days). This is due to long submission and approval cycle of bioconda. We recommend using standalone installation or Docker containers for most up-to-date versions.

> 💡 Use `mamba` instead of `conda` for faster installation.

> 💡 Bioconda does not support ARM architectures yet. So if you want maximum performance on these architectures (e.g. on AppleSilicon) use the standalone executable or compile from source.
