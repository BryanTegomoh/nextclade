# With Conda

> ⚠️Note that new versions may appear on bioconda with some delay (hours to days)

A [Nextclade conda package](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/nextclade) is available for Linux and macOS from `bioconda` channel:

```bash
conda install -c bioconda nextclade
```

Use `mamba` instead of `conda` for faster installation. Bioconda does not support arm64 architectures yet. So if you want maximum performance (~2x speedup) use the standalone executable or compile from source.
