### Phylogenetic tree view

In order to assign clades to sequences, Nextclade [places](../algorithm/05-phylogenetic-placement) all new sequences on a reference tree. You can view the resulting tree by clicking on the tree icon at the top right.

The tree is visualized by [Nextstrain Auspice](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/auspice/en/stable/). By default, only your uploaded sequences are highlighted.

One limitation to be aware of is that new sequences are placed one by one on the reference tree. Thus, no common internal nodes of new sequences are placed on the tree. If you are interested in seeing ancestral relationships between your sequences, we recommend you use [Usher](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPhyloPlace).
